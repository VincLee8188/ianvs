    "context": "During the reporting period, the scale of the bond portfolio declined slightly compared to 2021, resulting in a lower VaR of interest rate risk. The gold portfolio exposure was kept small, and the VaR of exchange rate risk was lower than the same period of the previous year; the silver portfolio exposure was also lower, leading to a slight decline in the VaR of commodity risk.\n\nThe Bank managed market risk of the banking book through exposure limit management, stress testing, scenario analysis, and gap analysis.\n\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that adverse changes in interest rate levels and maturity structures will cause losses to the economic value of the banking book and overall income. The interest rate risk mainly arises from the mismatch of maturity or repricing periods of assets and liabilities sensitive to interest rates.\n\nIn 2022, the Bank closely monitored macroeconomic and interest rate trends, implemented a prudential management strategy for interest rate risk, and adjusted the asset-liability duration structure to balance risks and returns. The Bank reinforced support for key and vulnerable fields of the real economy, optimized pricing strategies, and achieved sustainable growth of assets and liabilities. The interest rate risk management system was continuously improved, and stress test results indicated all interest rate risk indicators were within regulatory requirements and management targets, with the interest rate risk remaining controllable overall.",

Key judgements include whether the principal may change due to prepayments and whether interest includes only the time value of money and other basic borrowing risks.\n\n2. **Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance**: This requires complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior, including the likelihood of customer defaults and resulting losses.\n\n3. **Fair value of financial instruments**: The Group uses valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not quoted in an active market, including recent transaction prices, discounted cash flow analysis, and generally accepted pricing models. Market observable inputs are used when available, but management must make estimates in areas such as credit risk, liquidity, and volatilities, which could affect the estimated fair value.",

The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  \n\nIncome and expense of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss from the date of acquisition or up to the date on which control ceases, respectively.  \n\nAdjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to consistently reflect the accounting policies of the Group.  \n\nWhen merging, all intra-group transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.  \n\nNon-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately from the controlling party’s equity therein. The carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.  \n\nIn the Bank’s statement of financial position, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less impairment losses, if any.  \n\n**Business combinations**  \nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group, and any equity interests issued by the Group.  \n\nAt the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values; except that deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12 — Income Taxes and IAS 19 — Employee Benefits, respectively.  \n\nNon-controlling interests that represent ownership interests in the acquiree are accounted for at either fair value or the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

    "context": "**Financial Risk Management - Credit Risk**\n\n**Measurement of ECL:**\nThe Group sets quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine significant increases in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. Criteria include changes in credit risk classification, changes in the borrower’s Probability of Default (PD), overdue status, and other factors. \n\n- SICR is indicated when credit risk classification changes from Normal to Special Mention or when wholesale clients’ PD rises to a certain level.\n- For borrowers with a low original PD (e.g., lower than 3%), SICR occurs if the credit grade falls at least 5 notches.\n- For retail clients, SICR is indicated when PD exceeds a certain level.\n- According to IFRS 9, a financial instrument is considered to have experienced SICR if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on contractual payments.\n\nThe Group assumes that credit risk has not increased significantly if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, defined as consistent with a globally accepted low credit risk rating (e.g., external “investment grade” rating).\n\n**Definition of Credit-Impaired Financial Assets:**\nThe criteria to determine credit impairment under IFRS 9 include both quantitative and qualitative indicators. Factors considered include:\n\n- Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or borrower.\n- Breach of contract, such as default or past due events.\n- Concessions granted by the lender due to the borrower’s financial difficulty.\n- Probable bankruptcy or financial reorganization of the borrower.\n- Disappearance of an active market for the financial asset due to financial difficulties.\n- Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount reflecting incurred credit losses.\n- Borrower overdue for more than 90 days on any principal, advances, interest, or investment in bonds due to the Group.\n\nCredit impairment may result from the combined effect of multiple events rather than a single event.",
    "question": "What criteria does the Group use to determine significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition?",
    "answer": "The Group uses several criteria to determine significant increases in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, including changes in credit risk classification from Normal to Special Mention, increases in the Probability of Default (PD), overdue status, and other factors. For borrowers with a low original PD (e.g., lower than 3%), SICR occurs if the credit grade falls at least 5 notches. For retail clients, SICR is indicated when PD exceeds a certain level. Additionally, under IFRS 9, SICR is assumed if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on contractual payments."

The amendments specify that a right to defer settlement must exist at the end of the reporting period and have substance for a liability to be classified as non-current. Classification is unaffected by management’s intentions or expectations.  \n\nThe amendments also specify the classification of liabilities that will or may be settled by issuing an entity’s own equity instruments. The classification of such liability is not affected only when the conversion option is recognized separately from the host liability as an equity component under IAS 32.  \n\nThe amendments to IAS 1 (2022) specify that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. Future covenants do not affect a liability’s classification at that date. However, an entity is required to disclose information regarding the risk that non-current liabilities subject to future covenants could become repayable within twelve months after the end of the reporting period.  \n\nThe 2022 amendments defer the effective date of the 2020 amendments to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024.

A full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business. A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if those assets are in a subsidiary.  \n\nThe Group anticipates that the adoption of the amendments will not have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.",

    "answer": "The key changes introduced by the amendments to IAS 1 regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current include: 1) A liability can be classified as non-current if the right to defer settlement exists at the end of the reporting period and has substance, regardless of management's intentions or expectations. 2) The classification of liabilities to be settled by issuing equity instruments is unaffected when the conversion option is recognized separately from the host liability as an equity component under IAS 32. 3) Only covenants that must be complied with on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability. Future covenants do not affect classification at the reporting date, but information about the risk of non-current liabilities becoming repayable within twelve months due to future covenants must be disclosed."
