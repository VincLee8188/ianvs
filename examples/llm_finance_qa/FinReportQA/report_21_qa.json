    "context": "However, it is important to measure progress to prove capitalism is working. In the U.S. and globally, companies can track their performance in areas that include equality of opportunity, affordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, sustainable, clean, secure energy, and other priorities. We do so through reporting a set of universal Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM). Nearly 200 companies around the world have committed to reporting SCMs —and about 140 have already begun to do so. The metrics were developed with the expertise of the global Big Four accounting firms. This is the third consecutive year we have published these metrics in our Annual Report, in addition to our financial disclosures. We believe this provides the most relevant, useful and transparent information. This disclosure is comprehensive and straightforward, allowing you, our shareholders, to assess your company. \n\nBank of America’s focus on Responsible Growth is delivering results for you and helping us succeed through changing markets, as we continue to diligently serve our clients and help them achieve their short- and long-term financial goals. This Annual Report and the 2022 Proxy Statement are full of examples illustrating how our focus on Responsible Growth continues to provide Bank of America with the ability to deliver strong returns today, and the resilience to consistently serve our stakeholders in the future. \n\nIn support of this endeavor, your Board conducts ongoing discussions with the company’s senior Management Team to ensure Bank of America’s strategic alignment to Responsible Growth. This includes meeting with the Management Team to review and approve the company’s strategy, and conducting a year-round strategic assessment.",
