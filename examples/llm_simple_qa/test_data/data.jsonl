Given the following context from an annual report and a question, please provide a concise answer in English.\n\n--- Context ---\n**SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Financial instruments**\n\n**Financial assets**\n\n**Significant increases in credit risk**  \nIn assessing whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of default occurring on the financial instrument assessed at the balance sheet date with that assessed at the date of initial recognition.  \n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort, including forward-looking information. In particular, the following information is taken into account:  \n- Principal or interest of the instrument is more than 30 days past due;  \n- Credit rating of obligor changes significantly. Credit rating is based on both internal and external rating results, and the criteria are as follows:  \n  (i) a significant increase in credit risk is determined when internal and external rating during the reporting period is below the Group’s credit acceptance standards;  \n  (ii) The non-retail assets’ internal ratings are downgraded by 3 ranks or above upon initial recognition;  \n  (iii) Significant adverse issues have negative impacts on obligor’s repayment ability;  \n  (iv) Other circumstances of significant increase in credit risk.  \n\nDepending on the nature of the financial instruments, the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk is performed on either an individual basis or a collective basis. When the assessment is performed on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics, such as past due status and credit risk ratings.  \n\n**Definition of credit-impaired and default**  \nAt each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:  \n- Principal or interest of the asset is more than 90 days past due;  \n- The issuer or obligor is in significant financial difficulty, or has already become insolvent;  \n- It is becoming probable that the obligor will enter bankruptcy;  \n- An active market for that financial asset has disappeared because of financial difficulties of issuers;  \n- Other objective evidence indicating impairment of the financial asset.\n\n--- Question ---\nWhat criteria does the Group use to determine a significant increase in credit risk for financial assets?\n\nOutput only the answer in English, without additional commentary.", "answer": "The Group determines a significant increase in credit risk for financial assets by considering the following criteria:  \n- The principal or interest of the instrument is more than 30 days past due.  \n- A significant change in the credit rating of the obligor, where the rating falls below the Group’s credit acceptance standards, non-retail assets’ internal ratings are downgraded by 3 ranks or more, or significant adverse issues impact the obligor’s repayment ability.  \n- Other circumstances indicating a significant increase in credit risk.  \n\nThe assessment can be performed on an individual or collective basis, with financial instruments grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics."}

For these assets, expected credit losses are recognised for the following 12 months.  \nStage 2: For financial instruments with significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, expected credit losses are recognised for the remaining lifetime if there is no objective evidence of impairment.  \nStage 3: For financial assets with objective evidence of impairment as at the balance sheet date, expected credit losses are recognised for the remaining lifetime.  \n\nFinancial instruments that have low credit risk  \nThe credit risk on a financial instrument is considered low if the financial instrument has a low risk of default, the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.\n\n--- Question ---\nWhat criteria does the Group use to classify financial instruments into the three stages for measuring expected credit losses?\n\nOutput only the answer in English, without additional commentary.", "answer": "The Group classifies financial instruments into three stages for measuring expected credit losses based on the following criteria: \n\n- Stage 1: Financial instruments without a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

Expected credit losses are recognized for the remaining lifetime.\n- Stage 3: Financial assets with objective evidence of impairment as of the balance sheet date.

The Group performs liability adequacy tests based on information currently available, as at the reporting date. Additional insurance contract liabilities should be recorded if any deficiency exists.  \n\n**Credit related commitments and financial guarantees**  \nFinancial guarantees are initially recognised at fair value on the date the guarantee was given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of the initial amount, less amortisation of guarantee fees, and the best estimate of the expected credit loss provision required to settle the guarantee. The impairment allowance of loan commitments provided by the Group is measured by ECL.  \n\nFor credit related commitments and financial guarantees, the loss allowance is recognised as a provision.  \n\n**Fiduciary activities**  \nIn activities where the Group acts in a fiduciary capacity such as trustee, custodian or agent, the assets and income arising from the transaction together with the related undertakings to return the assets to customers are excluded from the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

The Group divides them into 3 stages by assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition to recognise ECL.  \n\nThe Group measures the ECL of a financial instrument in a way that reflects:  \n– an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;  \n– the time value of money;  \n– reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.  \n\nStage classification  \nThe Group divides them into 3 stages. Stage 1 is “financial assets without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition”, at which the Group only needs to measure ECL in the next 12 months. Stage 2 is “financial assets with significant increase in credit risk” and stage 3 is “credit-impaired financial assets”, at both of which the Group needs to measure lifetime ECL.  \n\nThe financial assets are moveable between stages. For instance, financial instruments originally classified at stage 1 should be downgraded to stage 2 if events occur such as a significant increase in credit risk. Financial instruments at stage 2 could be upgraded to stage 1 if credit risk decreases and the criteria for the determination of “a significant increase in credit risk” are no longer met.  \n\nDescription of parameters, assumptions and estimation techniques  \nThe Group recognises a loss allowance to different financial instruments at an amount equal to 12-month or lifetime expected credit loss based on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and whether the financial instrument is credit-impaired. ECL is the result of discounted product of the weighted average of “probability of default (PD)”, “loss given default (LGD)”, “exposure at default (EAD)” under the three scenarios.  \n\nProbability of default (PD) is the probability of default occurring of a client and its assets in a given period of time in the future.  \nExposure at default (EAD) represents the total amount of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposure at the time of default by debtor.  \nLoss given default (LGD) represents the percentage of amount of loss to be incurred in the event of default to the total risk exposure.  \n\nDefinition of default has been consistently applied to model establishment of probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), loss given default (LGD) in ECL calculation throughout the Group.\n\n--- Question ---\nHow does the Group classify financial assets in terms of credit risk and expected credit loss (ECL) measurement?\n\nOutput only the answer in English, without additional commentary.", "answer": "The Group classifies financial assets into three stages for credit risk and expected credit loss (ECL) measurement:  \n- Stage 1: Financial assets without a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, where ECL is measured over the next 12 months.  \n- Stage 2: Financial assets with a significant increase in credit risk, where lifetime ECL is measured.  \n- Stage 3: Credit-impaired financial assets, where lifetime ECL is also measured.  \n\nFinancial assets can move between stages based on changes in credit risk."}

The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that it does not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences on initial recognition. As a result, entities will need to recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for temporary differences arising on initial recognition of a lease and a decommissioning provision.  \n\n(v) Amendments to IFRS 16: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback  \nThe amendments add to the requirements explaining how an entity accounts for a sale and leaseback after the date of the transaction. The amendments require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a way that it does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains, including cases with variable lease payments in the leaseback.  \n\n(vi) Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants  \nThe amendments to IAS 1 (2020) concern the requirements on determining if a liability is current or non-current. In particular, the amendments specify the condition of an entity to classify a liability as non-current requires that a right to defer settlement must exist at the end of the reporting period and have substance, and clarify that classification is unaffected by management’s intentions or expectations about whether the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement.  \nThe amendments also specify the classification of liabilities that will or may be settled by issuing an entity’s own equity instruments. When a liability includes a counterparty conversion option that involves a transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments, the classification of such liability is not affected only when the conversion option is recognised separately from the host liability as an equity component under IAS 32.  \nThe amendments to IAS 1 (2022) specify that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. Covenants with which the entity must comply after the reporting date (i.e. future covenants) do not affect a liability’s classification at that date. However, an entity is required to disclose information regarding the risk that the non-current liabilities subject to future covenants could become repayable within twelve months after the end of the reporting period.  \nThe 2022 amendments defer the effective date of the 2020 amendments to\n\n--- Question ---\nWhat are the key changes introduced by the 2022 amendments to IAS 1 regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current?\n\nOutput only the answer in English, without additional commentary.", "answer": "The 2022 amendments to IAS 1 specify that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or non-current.

The date of renegotiation is considered to be the date of initial recognition for impairment calculation purposes. The Group assesses whether the new financial asset recognised is deemed to be credit-impaired at initial recognition. Differences in the carrying amount are recognised in profit or loss as a gain or loss on derecognition.  \nIf the terms are not substantially different, the renegotiation or modification does not result in derecognition, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash flows of the financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in profit or loss.  \n\nDerecognition other than on a modification  \nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and has not retained control.  \n\nThe Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards. These transactions are accounted for as ‘pass through’ transfers that result in derecognition if the Group:  \n– Has no obligation to make payments unless it collects equivalent amounts from the assets;  \n– Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and  \n– Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay.  \n\nCollateral furnished by the Group under standard repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions are not derecognised because the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards. This also applies to certain securitisation transactions in which the Group retains a subordinated residual interest.  \n\nWhen the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have been transferred, and the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, and has retained control of the transferred assets, the Group applies continuing involvement approach. Under this approach, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement and recognise the associated liability. The net carrying amount of the transferred asset and associated liability is: (a) the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by the Group, if the transferred asset is measured at amortised cost; or (b) equal\n\n--- Question ---\nWhat are the criteria for derecognizing financial assets when the terms of a loan are modified?\n\nOutput only the answer in English, without additional commentary.", "answer": "When the terms of a loan are modified, financial assets are derecognized if the terms are substantially different. The Group then recognizes a new financial asset at fair value, recalculates a new effective interest rate, and assesses whether the new asset is credit-impaired at initial recognition. Differences in the carrying amount are recognized in profit or loss as a gain or loss on derecognition. If the terms are not substantially different, the asset is not derecognized, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on revised cash flows, recognizing a modification gain or loss in profit or loss."}
