Some studies have quantified the logistical cost of recruiting and training new employees to be over 20 per cent of the cost due to the output lost until new employees are trained to an optimal level. The long-term impact of large skilled migration could be substantial due to the loss of productivity in the country, especially considering the overall ageing population. \n\nLiterature identifies positive spillovers of brain drain, particularly due to improved networks, skill transfer, and remittances. However, in the Sri Lankan context, costs may outweigh such benefits. Several short-term measures have been adopted by certain sectors to retain employees, such as pay hikes, flexible working conditions, and US dollar linked wages. These measures could be helpful in addressing the prevailing economic crisis. \n\nAddressing longstanding structural weaknesses in the economy that affect the quality of life and the creation of sustained growth will be essential to putting an end to the brain drain phenomenon.",

    "context": "The healthcare system was burdened with the country’s exposure to the spread of other communicable diseases during 2022. The number of dengue cases intensified substantially to 76,689 from 35,924 cases reported in the previous year, whereas dengue related deaths increased to 72 from 28 deaths in 2021. The rise in dengue cases in 2022 was largely attributable to lapses in executing dengue preventive measures due to shortages in pesticides and fuel. Prolongation of such shortages may cause continuity of the upward trend in dengue infestation in early 2023. \n\nThe MoH continued its engagement in promoting public awareness regarding prevention, diagnosis, control, and management of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). A revised National Policy and Strategic Framework for Prevention and Control of NCDs in Sri Lanka was published for public comment, while the Multi Sectoral Strategic Action Plan on Injury Prevention and Management, Sri Lanka 2021–2025 was launched in 2022. Several physical activity promotion programmes and healthy diet programmes were conducted with the aim of reducing the incidence of NCDs, especially targeting the youth population. \n\nFurther, MoH continued to engage in cancer control activities at the primary care level, including early detection and prevention. A cancer early detection centre became operational during the year at the Rathnapura teaching hospital. Nevertheless, amidst reduced availability of medical and pharmaceutical supplies in the country, continuing treatment for NCD patients proved to be challenging, creating a disproportionate bearing on vulnerable groups of the population. Against this backdrop, there is a dire need to prioritise the requisites for health emergencies and adequate provisioning of budgetary allocation.",
