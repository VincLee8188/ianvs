Banks continue to navigate the operational and market-related effects of the pandemic and substantial government stimulus. Additionally, cyber threats are elevated and continue to evolve, with an observed increase in attacks on the financial services industry. \n\nThe OCC, along with our federal banking agency partners, implemented a final rule establishing computer-security incident notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers. This rule requires banks to provide the OCC with timely notification of computer-security incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the viability of banks’ operations, customers’ ability to access their deposit and other accounts, or the stability of the financial sector.\n\nMaintaining cybersecurity vigilance is crucial as the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of today’s operating environment and continued cybersecurity threats pose a growing safety and soundness risk to banks and the broader financial sector if not properly managed.\n\nThe U.S. financial system today is substantially more protected from instability because of the extraordinary efforts of Congress, the federal banking agencies, the FSOC, and banks themselves. However, threats remain. \n\nThe annual Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience Report provides Congress with an overview of measures that the OCC takes to strengthen cybersecurity with respect to the agency’s functions as a regulator.

The OCC records liabilities for amounts that are likely to be paid due to events that have occurred as of the relevant balance sheet dates. The OCC’s liabilities consist of routine operating accounts payable, accrued payroll and benefits, deferred revenue, and other liabilities.\n\nWith the public investments, net: The OCC also invests available funds held outside the Treasury in a money market mutual fund that operates as a “government money market fund.” It is the OCC’s policy to invest in held-to-maturity securities. The fair value of these investments is based on the fair value measurement hierarchy classification, Level 1.\n\nAccounts Receivable, Net: The OCC updates the allowance for loss on accounts receivable with the public periodically to reflect the most current estimate of accounts that probably will be uncollectible. Assessments are recognized as earned revenue on a straight-line basis. The unearned portions of collected assessments are classified as deferred revenue.\n\nContingent liabilities: The OCC recognizes and discloses contingencies for pending or threatened litigation and unasserted claims. The OCC accrues an estimated loss if it is probable and the agency is able to reasonably estimate the amount.\n\nGeneral Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net: General property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and internal-use software are accounted for at cost. General PP&E purchased at a cost greater than or equal to the established capitalization thresholds are capitalized at cost and depreciated or amortized. Depreciation is expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nEmployment Benefits: All OCC employees participate in one of three retirement systems—the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), or the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan.
